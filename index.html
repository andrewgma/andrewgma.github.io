    <div class="info">
      <p>Welcome. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013 with a B.A. in Mathematics from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and a B.S. in Economics (with concentration in Statistics) from the Wharton School.
      <p>I was a software engineer at <a href="https://www.styleseat.com/">StyleSeat</a> in 2014, building the largest consumer marketplace in the beauty industry (over $1 billion in appointments booked). There, I experienced the excitement and challenges of a fast growing startup, and gained proficiency in Python and JavaScript. I left to pursue other interests.
      <p>In the past, I interned at <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> and <a href="http://www.lab126.com/index.htm">Lab126</a>, Amazon's Kindle R&amp;D lab.
      <p>Here are some projects I have worked on:</p>

      <div class="proj-desc">Project for Statistics 434 (Time Series) at Penn.
      <br>We use time series models to predict Bitcoin prices with some success. We also demonstrate a basic trading scheme to show opportunities that exist in Bitcoin exchanges (see <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wkvna749l24cni/btc%20presentation.pdf">handout</a>).

      <div class="proj-desc">Project for Statistics 476 (Applied Probability Models in Marketing) at Penn.
      <br>I use probability models to forecast lifetime visits based on visitor frequency studies at Yosemite National Park. I tell a story about Yosemite's "visitor markets" and differences in visitor behavior inferred by the model.
