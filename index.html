		Welcome. I graduate from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. I am a candidate for dual degrees in mathematics and business from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and the Wharton School.
		<p>Here are some projects I have worked on:

		<p><a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/pennapps-spring-2013/hacks/beets-jam-finder">Beets JamFinder</a>
		<br>Pitch: Discover new music, playing live near you tonight. Embedded SoundCloud player lets you sample the artist's jams. For web and iOS.
		<br>Built in under 40 hours with a team of four at PennApps Spring 2013. I built the web app front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end uses Python and Flask.
		<br>We won the prize for "Best use of a Mashery API."

		<p><a href="http://pennasb.org/">pennasb.org</a>
		<br>Website for Penn Alternate Spring Break built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I served on the group's executive board for two terms from 2011-2013.

		<p><u>SnapStand - inexpensive, portable, universal laptop stand</u>
		<br>Project for OPIM 415, a product design course at Penn.
		<br>My team built a laptop stand. My main role was managerial, guiding the product design and vision.

		<p><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tddg34msyrszsvo/476project1.pdf">Paper modeling national park visit frequency</a>
		<br>Project for Statistics 476 (Applied Probability Models in Marketing) at Penn.
		<br>I use probability models to forecast lifetime visits based on visitor frequency studies at Yosemite National Park. I also tell a story about Yosemite's "visitor markets" and differences in visitor behavior inferred by the model.

		<p>I will be working full time at <a href="http://www.findthebest.com/">FindTheBest</a> starting in June 2013. In the past, I have interned at <a href="http://www.marklogic.com/">MarkLogic</a> and <a href="http://www.lab126.com/index.htm">Lab126</a>, Amazon's Kindle R&amp;D group.

		<p>This site is a work in progress. (Please see pennasb.org for my stylesheet abilities.) I can be reached at 4ndrew@gmail.com.
